random color for each player
turrets that can be aimed

world boundaries
projectile force
only do one thing at once (no moving and firing)
obstacles (trees, rocks): eventually randomized
explosions deform the landscape
motion follows the landscape
cooler player geometry
simulate wind that alters projectile trajectory
