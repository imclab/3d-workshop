* change direction
* turrets that can be aimed
* projectile emitting
* simulate wind that alters projectile trajectory
* add basic lighting
* projectile disappears
* camera follows the player (camera modes: world and player)
* explosions deform the landscape
* player motion follows the landscape
* cooler player geometry
* fix height interpolation on tank motion
* improve crater formation

random color for each player
name for player
health bar floats above player
reduce terrain update area
create lookup function to get surface normal for any terrain coordinate
particles for motion, smoke, fire
respawn upon empty health
multiple landscapes (terrain shader)
crater texture (charred mesh!)
water!
score for kills, accuracy
sound!

world boundaries (define the landscape)
projectile force
cool down period for firing
obstacles (trees, rocks): eventually randomized
shared physics engine
time bomb (alters running time for other players)
