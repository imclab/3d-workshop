* change direction
* turrets that can be aimed
* projectile emitting
* simulate wind that alters projectile trajectory
* add basic lighting
* projectile disappears
* camera follows the player (camera modes: world and player)
random color for each player
world boundaries (define the landscape)
explosions deform the landscape
player motion follows the landscape
projectile force
cool down period for firing
obstacles (trees, rocks): eventually randomized
cooler player geometry
shared physics engine
time bomb (alters running time for other players)
