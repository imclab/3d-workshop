* change direction
random color for each player
turrets that can be aimed
projectile force
only do one thing at once (no moving and firing)
camera follows the player (camera modes: world and player)
world boundaries
obstacles (trees, rocks): eventually randomized
explosions deform the landscape
motion follows the landscape
cooler player geometry
simulate wind that alters projectile trajectory
