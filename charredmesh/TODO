* change direction
* turrets that can be aimed
cool down period for firing
projectile force
random color for each player
only do one thing at once (no moving and firing)
camera follows the player (camera modes: world and player)
world boundaries
obstacles (trees, rocks): eventually randomized
explosions deform the landscape
motion follows the landscape
cooler player geometry
simulate wind that alters projectile trajectory
time bomb (alters running time for other players)
shared physics engine
